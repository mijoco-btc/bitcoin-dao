# EcosystemDAO

This Ecosystem DAO is for the Stacks community and seeks to provide a means by which the community
can have a voice in key decision making processes such as SIP activation criteria and funding programs. It could even potentially play a role in the Stacks Foundation grant process itself. In general the community will decide the role and use of the Ecosystem DAO itself.

This project is forked from the extremely versatile and modular ExecutorDAO. As such it serves
as a working example of the Clarity Smart Contract programmig language in action - and one of the
explicit aims of the project is to bring Clarity code into the User Interface where it can be
discussed in the context of evolving the DAO. For more information and design specifics, see [ExecutorDAO](https://github.com/Clarity-Innovation-Lab/bitcoin-l2-dao).
