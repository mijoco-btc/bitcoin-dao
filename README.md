# Bitcoin DAO

This Bitcoin DAO is for the Stacks community and seeks to provide a means by which the community can have a voice in key decision making processes such as SIP activation criteria and funding programs. It could even potentially play a role in the Stacks Foundation grant process itself. In general the community will decide the role and use of the Bitcoin DAO itself.

This project is forked from the extremely versatile and modular ExecutorDAO. As such it serves as a working example of the Clarity Smart Contract programming language in action - and one of the explicit aims of the project is to bring Clarity code into the User Interface where it can be discussed in the context of evolving the DAO. For more information and design specifics, see [ExecutorDAO](https://github.com/Clarity-Innovation-Lab/bitcoin-dao).
